# Library-Management-System
This is an online library management system which has python and tkinter as front-end while, CSV files in back-end.
Extensive use of machine-learning modules have been made. Libraries like Pandas, Matlplotlib, PIL, Numpy has been employed to give the project a more realistic look.
The program is mainly menu-driven and specifically coded to work on a specific CSV data-base which has limited access.
We can add, remove, view the available books. It is also designed to compare the relative popularity of books over a period of time.
It is also possible to keep a track of the members who are part of the library and, we are allowed to edit that list.
The most attractive part about the program is that, it has a login system which allows to access the main program after giving a correct set of user-id and password.
The data-bases used in the project are available on request.
